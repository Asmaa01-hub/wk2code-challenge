My Shopping List

 This is my shopping list. It's like when you write down things you want to buy at the store. Here's how it works:

How to Use:
Add Items: You can type the name of the thing you want to buy in the box at the top. Then click "Add Item" and it will show up on the list below.

Mark Purchased: When you buy something on your list, you can click "Mark Purchased" to show that you got it. Maybe it will change color or disappear!

Clear All: If you don't want your list anymore or want to start over, you can click "Clear All" and it will erase everything.

How it Works:
Adding Items: Type what you want in the box at the top. Then click "Add Item" to put it on your list.

Marking Purchased: After you buy something, click "Purchase" next to the item. It will change to "Purchased"!

Clearing the List: If you want to erase everything and start over, click "Clear All".

Code Stuff:
JavaScript Magic: This webpage uses JavaScript to keep track of what I want to buy. It's like magic! âœ¨
Functions: There are special functions that make everything work:
addItem(): Adds what I type to my list.
togglePurchased(): Changes an item from "Purchase" to "Purchased" when I buy it.
clearList(): Clears everything on my list.
